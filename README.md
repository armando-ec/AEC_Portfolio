# AEC_Portfolio
A display of the projects I have worked on.

## [Los 100 de Marca](https://github.com/armando-ec/projects)
* Scraped a [website](https://www.marca.com/futbol/top-100.html) to collect data.
* Cleaned the data and created a dataframe.
* Created aggregated values for each column.
* Plotted the data.
* Used: Selenium, Geopandas, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
